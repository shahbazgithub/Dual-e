A book publishing is the biggest issue in India as well as in Rajasthan, every new writer/student/homemaker woman  faces an issue in publishing a single book, it's also more difficult for a student publish a book/research paper.  Most Indian publishers look for well-established writers, so new writers find it difficult to break into print. â€œThe entire process is fraught with trouble, A lot of time and money is spent on basics,  getting an ISBN (International Standard Book Number) is also very difficult. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So we have the solution for e-publishing and self publishing.
